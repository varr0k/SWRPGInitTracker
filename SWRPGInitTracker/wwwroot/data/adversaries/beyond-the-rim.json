They often fall prey to the planet’s fearsome predators, many of which can strip a bark rat tree-nest bare within minutes. The bark rat is no easy meal, however, thanks to its thick hide, quick bursts of speed, and prehensile, whip-like tail.\n\nThe creature is covered in a thick, leathery hide that mimics the rough texture and appearance of Cholganna’s roughest tree bark. It also has a chameleon-like colour adaptation quality, making it difficult to spot when still. The bark rat is an omnivore with small ears, a flat nose, and teeth equally suited to vegetation or flesh.\n\nBark rats typically live within dead tree trunks or large branches, which they hollow out. They are not particularly perceptive; it is not uncommon for them to inadvertently remove too much material, causing a dead limb or a tree to fall, especially if a heavy predator lands on the tree. A fallen tree-nest is instantly abandoned, sending bark rats scurrying about the wilderness, eventually to regroup at a new tree. If a tree falls due to a predator, a dozen rats swarm the attacker while the others flee. Their battle tactics combine their speed and numbers. They keep on the move while their tails whip and lacerate attackers’ legs and soft underbellies. If a target falls to the ground or is wrapped around a tree limb or trunk, they swarm over it, biting and clawing at it from all sides.",

Pack hunters that rely on stealth and agility, the octopi wrap themselves around large tree trunks or solid tree limbs and ensnare unwitting prey as it passes below. Once an arboreal octopus has grabbed its victim, it tries to haul it up to a higher perch to eat its meal.\n\nThe arboreal octopus is a mottled brown-green colour, ideally suited for concealing itself among the tree trunks and branches. Its skin is flexible but difficult to pierce. Its central body is round and less flexible and covered in heavy fur and thick hairs. The octopus is difficult to sneak up on, as it has four eyes distributed evenly around the centre of its body and a pair of eyes at the top of its head. Its mouth, centred on its ventral side, sports pointed, razor-sharp teeth.\n\nFour of its tentacles are used primarily for climbing and moving about. These possess spikes and short claws along their lengths, enabling the creature to latch on and keep an impossibly tight hold on its perch. The other three tentacles are used mainly for hunting. Each ends in a triple-pronged talon for injuring its prey as it captures it. The tentacle also secretes a sticky substance along its length that helps hold prey while the octopus moves from limb to limb.",
