		"description": "Setenna Hase was raised in a middle-class family on the Corellian world of Tralus near the end of the Republic. She left her world to travel the galaxy at a young age, possessed with a powerful wanderlust to see new and exciting worlds. Traveling through the Core Worlds and on to the Outer Rim for close to a decade, Hase studied numerous cultures, philosophies, and beliefs among other species.\n\nAs the Republic fell and the Empire rose to power, many of these cultures fell under the oppression of the Empire and their New Order. Appalled to see people she had studied under and lived with subjected to such misery, Setenna began looking into the Rebellion. Then an Imperial raid killed Setenna’s beloved mentor, a pacifist Ithorian philosopher named Borrosel. Setenna Hase joined the Rebellion and never looked back.\n\nSetenna’s intellect and drive allowed her to rise among her peers and become a valuable leader whose knowledge of the galaxy and cultures makes her an effective leader and cunning strategist. Setenna looks older than she is, though she is actually thirty-four years old and has the energy to prove it. The woman looks up to General Niall but is known to clash with the up-and-coming Duros Commander Qurno.",

		"description": "Ran Niall was a decorated Imperial Navy captain during the early years of the Empire, captaining the vessel the *Pride of Stars*. The ship had travelled to the Imperial shipyards above Mon Cala for routine maintenance and crew leave. During this leave, Niall witnessed an atrocity on the surface of the planet, as Imperial stormtroopers gunned down a series of shopkeepers who had spoken out against rising taxation and harsh penalties imposed by the Empire. This event shook Niall to his core and changed his life forever.\n\nWhile the ship was undergoing repairs, Niall decided to strike out with his vessel, vowing that he would find a more honourable government for which to fight His bridge crew consisted of people whom he trusted implicitly, and they had no reservations about joining him in his rebellion. In the decades since, Ran Niall has been a vital member of the Alliance, adding his leadership and tactical acumen to many victories against the Empire. An assault corvette’s turbolaser scuttled the Pride of Stars years ago, and today Niall spends most of his time commanding from Arda I, though he longs to be at the forefront of the battle lines, engaging the Empire directly.\n\nGeneral Niall is the oldest and most experienced of the base’s leaders, with a full head of silver-blond hair buzzed short. He sees the potential in both Setenna and Danel and teaches them as much as he can, so they can one day be leaders in their own right. He values the life of every soldier under his command and is beloved by them in return, though he is strict with those who disobey him or the other commanders.",

He lived a quiet life, focused on his job as a law-man in the town of Davoras on the Outer Rim world of Ralgos. The Duros was a diligent member of the security forces, and he took his job very seriously. When an Imperial Victory-class Star Destroyer arrived in orbit around Ralgos and began bombarding the planet with its turbolaser batteries, Qurno could do nothing but stand and watch the devastation levelled against his world. Qurno never found out what the Imperials were even after in their destruction of numerous cities on Ralgos. What the Empire did achieve that day was cementing Danel Qurno’s role in joining the Arda I Rebels, a decision he has never regretted as he travels the galaxy and witnesses the unspeakable horrors carried out by the forces of the Emperor.\n\nCommander Qurno is the youngest of the three—the most brash and the most headstrong. He craves the deference given to General Niall and tries endlessly to prove himself, much to Setenna’s annoyance. He is tense around her, though inwardly, he wants her approval and respect most of all.",

Jocaos quickly rose through the ranks of this agency, and soon his superiors dispatched him to carry out a number of secret projects for the IIS. Returning to his home-world of Ord Radama, Malau Jocaos worked under orders to bring agents onboard who could infiltrate the Rebellion and expose its secrets. Long suspecting that his former schoolmate Var Narek had joined the Rebellion, Jocaos masterminded the bombing of Var’s brother’s shop to set Var back on the true path.\n\nMalau has great disdain for Governor Orgraal, seeing him as nothing more than a low-level politician and not worthy of his post.
