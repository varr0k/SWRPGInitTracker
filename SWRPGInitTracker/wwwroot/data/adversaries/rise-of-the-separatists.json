Dooku has since reclaimed his birthright as Count of Serenno, inheriting a fortune. His wealth, coupled with his intense gravitas and natural charm, enabled him to recruit rich and powerful allies.

		"description": "Technically known as Pistoeka sabotage droids, these diminutive machines seem more like animate munitions than actual members of the droid army. Typically deployed out of discord missiles or similar dispersal mechanisms, buzz droids are released to tear apart enemy vehicles such as starfighters and transports. Although they are individually little threat even to a lightly armoured fighter, a swarm of buzz droids can quickly strip a ship of its plating and begin tearing apart vital systems. Removing buzz droids from a ship usually requires daredevil piloting or intervention from other droids serving aboard the vessel, such as a fighter’s astromech co-pilot, as a pilot can hardly spare the attention to deal with the droids directly while mid-flight. Despite their destructive capabilities, buzz droids are little threat to combatants who find a way to confront them. The armaments are specialised tools, rather than true weapons, and they have little to nothing in the way of armour or redundant systems, as the CIS manufacturers designed them to be disposable weapons.",

When facing a fortified or stationary target, the droids are sometimes equipped with demolition charges to deploy during their infiltration. C-8 saboteur droids are compact units, standing only 1.7 metres tall. Nevertheless, their matte-black plating and featureless face plates are intimidating to those who spot them; they resemble nothing so much as a void in humanoid form. When they are not in combat their armaments are stored in internal compartments, so as to benefit from the sensor-defeating properties of their armour plating.",

The S-43 enforcer droids are based on stolen Separatist plans for battle droids, but they have undergone a number of adjustments to better suit their manufacturers’ interests. Since the enforcer droids are regularly deployed against underworld lowlifes and negligent debtors, the Hutts have skimped on reinforcement for the the droids’ chassis as an unnecessary cost, making them more fragile than even basic B1 battle droids. However, the droids are equipped with upgraded processors designed to help them deal with the trickery and deception common to their operations, as well as integrated weaponry so that they can never be disarmed. Even given the consortium’s attempts to save costs where possible, the enforcer droid project has been a considerable investment. Nevertheless, it has already begun to pay dividends, as orders of the droids pout in from crime lords across the galaxy.",
