She was moved to the Grand Army of the Republic for the duration of the Clone Wars, and she participated in the bombardment of Xorrn at the end of the conflict. She stayed on while the Republic became the Galactic Empire. After bearing witness to the subjugation of Rampa I, she resigned and went home to Gall.\n\nStruck by the ruin her hometown had become under Jans Coorsa’s leadership, Hardin became involved with clan politics and was quickly named patrician of the Hardin family.

There, Hardin’s experience was invaluable in reactivating Foundry Four and creating the orbital repair yard. After Jans died, Hardin opposed his grandson, who sought higher·profile clients, particularly the Rebellion.",

		"description": "Jorec and Mard faithfully served King Molec, and Queen Scintel before him, as the royal archivists, but they were reassigned as registrars on Kowak to oversee the prince’s actions on behalf of the crown. The two have served as a roadblock to the prince’s youthful decadence ever since. Come auction night, the ageing brothers take every precaution to ensure a successful and profitable evening. The two are convinced the prince’s entire operation would fall down around his ears were it not for their guidance.\n\nNo-one would suspect Jorec and Mard are fraternal twins. Jorec is a large, broadly built Zygerrian who is friendly, but simple and unkempt. His brother Mard is short and wiry, and overcompensates for his less-than-intimidating stature with an abrasive attitude and meticulous grooming.\n\nWhile proud to serve the crown, Jorec and Mard resent being on a backwater to babysit the prince, whom they consider an embarrassment to the royal family. Their anger at the king has forced them to question their entire way of life. The twins’ loyalty to the crown is weakened by their burning desire to return home to Zygerria, preferably at the expense of the prince. The latter impulse can be exploited to convince them to help the Rebellion.",

Rajim’s uncanny ability to read others and his skill as a duellist also made him the ideal bodyguard for the prime minister whom he continued to serve when the prime minister became King Atai Molec.\n\nCaptain Armin served as King Molec’s eyes and ears during the king’s sons’ fateful tour of Zygerrian holdings. When the elder heir was killed in a skirmish with Imperials, Armin shared the blame and was relieved of his duties to the throne. Armin was relegated to serve as the younger prince’s second-in-command on Kowak, far away from the capital.\n\nCaptain Armin is a tall, angular Zygerrian noble of great stature and impeccable breeding. He never strays too far from the prince, standing at attention in perfect military dress. Armin is incredibly smart, terribly insightful, and painfully bored with his station at the prince’s side. Despite the monotony of his role and the shame of his demotion Captain Armin takes great pride in his work and always does what is best for the throne.",

Sono also runs a poaching operation, supplying Kowakian monkey-lizards to buyers all over the galaxy. Since assuming control of Kowak, Prince Molec has divided slave supply worlds in the Trailing Sectors with both the Thalassian slavers and the Karazak Slavers’ Cooperative.\n\nDespite his “accomplishments” Prince Molec has never earned the respect of his father. Two years ago, Sono was touring Zygerrian holdings in the southern Slice with his older brother Hordem and recklessly got drawn into a naval engagement with Captain Nervi. The batlle ended with the defeat of the Molec forces and the death of Sono’s brother. The death of the king’s first heir drove a wedge between Sono and his father that ended in his pseudo-exile to Kowak.\n\nPrince Molec maintains a sabacc face as unreadable as ferrocrete, making him hard to read during negotiations. He leads a decadent lifestyle both personally and professionally, and he has many vices, including alcohol, gambling, and spice. Prince Molec also takes a morbid pleasure in the misery of others. However, beneath his egotistical facade, the prince is paranoid. Sono is convinced that servants within his court actively plot to depose him, which slowly chips away at his self-assured exterior.",
