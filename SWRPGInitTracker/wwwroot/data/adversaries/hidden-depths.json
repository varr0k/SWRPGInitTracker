The troops stationed on Phemis are from such a training programme, and have traded in their standard issue armaments for carbines and long-bladed vibroknives more appropriate to combat in the planet’s cavern systems. They also wear lighter, flexible armour similar to that worn by scout troopers.",

The Stormtrooper who would earn the epithet “Ironarm” was among the first batch of enlisted men to join the Corps as clones began to fall out of favour.\n\nHe served with brutal, if undistinguished, efficiency until a mission pitted his squad against a rogue Jedi who had escaped the fall of the Order. He lost his squad and his arm in that fight, but took the Jedi down alone after her last reserves were spent. Legend among the Stormtrooper Corps has it that he earned his unofficial designation not because of his cybernetic replacement, but because he choked the life from his quarry with his remaining arm during the fight. Whatever the truth, Ironarm does not speak of it except through the pitiless gleam that emerges in his eyes at the mention of the Jedi.",
